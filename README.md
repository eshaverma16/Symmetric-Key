# Symmetric-Key

This Python based Program will give you a Symmetric Key for your message which will be used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
Here you will get 3 different files named as:
1. Symmetric_Key.py 
2. Encryption_with_key.py 
4. Decryption.py

# How to use this Project:
###### Step 1: Run the Symmetric_Key.py File

You will get a Symmetric Key to Encrypt and Decrypt the data, now you can note this key down for future use.

###### Step 2: Run the Encryption_with_key.py File 

It will ask for symmetric key, Just paste the same Key and Then enter you message you want to Encrypt

###### Step 3: Run the Decryption.py File

Here you can decrypt the data using the same symmetric key you got from the Symmetric_Key.py file
